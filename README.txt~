This is a digital picture frame project based upon a description at this web-site:

I started out with an Adafruit breakout board for the Avago APDS9960 Gesture Sensor:
- Adafruit item number 3595

1. I tried to use a port of the Sparkfun software for their version of
the breakout but could not get the gesture detection capability to
work. The port of the Sparkfun software is available via the web site
above.

2. Next, I ported over Adafruit's Arduino code. That seems to work OK.
